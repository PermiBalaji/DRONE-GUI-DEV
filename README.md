This GUI served as a central 
hub for users to interact with the drone, offering features such as live video transmission, 
flight controls, and spray parameter modifications. Additionally, the GUI included a login 
window for user authentication, ensuring secure access to the application. Real-time 
indicators, such as date, time, and battery level, were incorporated to enhance operational 
efficiency and situational awareness for operators. The GUI also integrated the Google Maps 
API for precise location tracking, enabling users to monitor the drone's position in real-time.
The development of a wireless sensing unit, responsible for collecting and transmitting data 
between sensors and the GUI. The unit included an ultrasonic sensor for fluid level 
monitoring and a GPS module for accurate location tracking. Performance evaluation of the 
wireless sensing unit demonstrated its exceptional accuracy in determining fluid levels and 
GPS coordinates, highlighting its reliability in agricultural drone applications. Error 
handling mechanisms, such as QDebug statements, ensured smooth operation and effective 
troubleshooting. Furthermore, the project focused on determining the area of application and 
calculating the application rate for spraying operations. Through field evaluations, the 
system demonstrated its effectiveness in applying agricultural inputs within the expected 
parameters. The calculated area of application and application rate aligned with industry 
standards, confirming the system's suitability for precision agriculture. Overall, this project 
represented a significant step towards optimizing agricultural practices through the 
integration of cutting-edge technology, paving the way for sustainable and efficient farming 
operations.
